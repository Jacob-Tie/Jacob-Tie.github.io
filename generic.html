									<h3 class="major">Synchonized Neural Networks -- Computational Neurology</h3>
									<p>Computational neurology is a big interest of mine, because I can see how many of the ideas of data science came to be. The first Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were modeled after neural networks within the brain, and I find learning those intuitions fascinating. In this project specifically, I started by replicating results of a paper on how neural networks can become synchronized (all neurons firing at the same time). This concept of neural synchronization is widely applicable for understanding things like muscle contraction and circadian rhythm, so I decided to extend the paper by looking at how other neural structures can disrupt or cause synchronization in a non-isolated neural network. This involved simulating two neural networks that were connected, but which had different internal properties from one another and seeing if one neural network could influence another. The results of the simulation were that another network could, under the right circumstances, influence another to get synchronization.</p>

									<p>This project may seem somewhat out of place amongst my others since it is not using an Artificial Neural Network, but rather it is a simulation of ‘real’, biological neurons. I include this in the showcase of my work because it exemplifies some of my interests outside of data science. A complete, very long, implementation/extended explanation can be found below:</p>

									<h3 class="major">Computer Vision -- Deep Learning</h3>
									<p>Computer vision was something that really captured my imagination, both now and as a student. I liked its intersection with art and math, as well as its wide applicability to the modern world. This prompted me to focus a plethora of projects on implementing computer vision models from the recent literature on the subject. A subset of these can be found below:</p>
