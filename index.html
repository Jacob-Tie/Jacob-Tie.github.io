									<h2>Machine Learning Research Assistant</h2>
									<p>I am currently working with a team to make an AI for the purpose of real time epidemiological monitoring. My involvement has been primarily in making a 
									'symptom predictor' which takes a natural language input and outputs a list of symptoms that were endorsed in the input. This model is getting well over 99% accuracy
									with a positive predictive value of around 88% (note that we are predicting a sparse matrix), and was implemented using data of over a million samples.

									<h2>Master's Thesis</h2>
									<p>The thesis project for my Master's was centered on surveying many different machine learning implementations for predicting
									height from genetic data. The main purpose of this project was to see if a neural network approach could outperform a typical
									statistical learning approach that is used in practice (lasso regression). None of the other models that we attempted could out
									perform lasso regression, but one novel approaches I applied as well as the lasso regression implementation
									can be found by clicking the 'learn more' button.</p>

							<h2>Projects Showcase </h2>
							<p>Here are some projects that I think show some of my skills, but which I couldn't fit into my resume.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Image to Image Translation</h3>
									<p>In this project implemented several common ways of solving the 'image translation' problem. The specific translation I perform is taking satellite images and converting them to abstract map images.
									For this project I use different conceptions of what a GAN's loss should be and compare them.</p>

									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Image Segmentation</h3>
									<p>For this project I implemented a modern neural network for image segmentation. This makes use of a dual task loss which predicts both the edges around the image and the segmentation itself.</p>

									<h3>Generative Adversarial Neural Networks with Attention</h3>
									<p>In this project I implement a neural network which uses attention to augment the normal Generative Adversarial Network's construction.</p>
									<ul class="actions">
									<li><a href="GANsWithAttention.html" class="button">Learn more</a></li>
									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Adversarial Generative Neural Networks</h3>
									<p>In this project I implemented an idea I had to use GANs to try and generate adversarial examples without the need to optimize every adversarial case separately.
									This worked, though it was subsequently brought to my attention that this had already been done.</p>
									<ul class="actions">
									<li><a href="AdversarialGANs.html" class="button">Learn more</a></li>
									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Synchronized Neural Networks</h3>
									<p>In this project I consider biological neural networks, and I both extend and replicate results on synchronization (when two biological neural networks fire at the same time).
									This dives a lot more into the weeds of math and statistics, but it shows what I can bring to a team working with more direct mathematical methods.</p>

									<li><a href="Synchronized_Neural_Networks.html" class="button">Learn more</a></li>
									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Statistical Analysis of Pharmaceutical Mechanisms of Action</h3>
									<p>In this project I use standard statistical analysis techniques (linear regression and lasso regression) to get a better understanding of how we can use statistical modeling to 
									increase the speed with which we discover how pharmaceuticals work. Part of this project was done in R and part was done in Python.</p>
